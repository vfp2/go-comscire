--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Information
===================

libqwqng-1.4 - A library (using libftdi) which allows access to Comscire 
QNG devices.

libqwqng requires the open source library libFTDI1 installed. 
In addition, libusb 1.0 API is needed by libFTDI1 to access FTDI devices. 

*** WARNING *** LIBUSB by design allows other applications to assume control 
of any USB device including QNG devices. Only one QNG device can be attached 
to any computer. This is a possible security issue of Linux that is out of 
our control.
